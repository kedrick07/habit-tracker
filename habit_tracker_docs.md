# Habit Tracker Application - Project Documentation

## üìã Project Overview

### Purpose
A web-based habit tracking application that allows users to create, manage, and monitor their daily habits. Users can track their progress, view streaks, and analyze their consistency over time.

### Target Users
- Individuals looking to build positive habits
- People trying to break bad habits
- Anyone wanting to track personal goals and maintain accountability

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework:** Streamlit (Python-based web framework)
- **Backend Language:** Python 3.11
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas (Cloud NoSQL database)
- **Authentication:** Bcrypt (Password hashing)
- **Environment Management:** Conda

---

## üéØ Core Functionality

### 1. User Authentication System

#### Registration (Sign Up)
- User provides: Name, Email, Password, Confirm Password
- System validates:
  - Email format is correct
  - Password meets minimum requirements (at least 6 characters)
  - Password and confirm password match
  - Email doesn't already exist in database
- System creates new user account:
  - Password is hashed using bcrypt (never stored as plain text)
  - User record is saved to MongoDB Users collection
  - User is automatically logged in after registration

#### Login
- User provides: Email, Password
- System validates:
  - Email exists in database
  - Password matches hashed password in database
- System creates user session:
  - User information is stored in Streamlit session state
  - User remains logged in until they log out or close browser

#### Logout
- User clicks logout button
- System clears session state
- User is redirected to login page

#### Session Management
- When user is logged in, their user_id is stored in session
- All database operations use this user_id to ensure data isolation
- If user refreshes page, session persists (until browser closes)

---

### 2. Habit Management (CRUD Operations)

#### Create Habit
**User Journey:**
1. User navigates to "Add New Habit" page
2. User fills out form:
   - Habit Name (required) - e.g., "Morning Exercise"
   - Category (required) - dropdown: Health, Productivity, Finance, Learning, Fitness, Mindfulness, Other
   - Description (optional) - e.g., "30 minutes of yoga"
   - Start Date (required) - defaults to today
3. User clicks "Create Habit" button
4. System validates inputs (name not empty, valid date)
5. System saves habit to database with logged-in user's user_id
6. User sees success message
7. Habit appears in user's habit list

**Database Operation:**
- Insert new document into Habits collection
- Document includes: user_id, name, category, description, start_date, created_at

---

#### Read/View Habits
**User Journey:**
1. User navigates to Dashboard or "My Habits" page
2. System queries database for all habits belonging to logged-in user
3. System displays habits in organized format:
   - **Dashboard View:** Cards or table showing all habits with quick stats
   - **Today's Check-in View:** List of habits with checkboxes for today
   - **Individual Habit View:** Detailed page showing single habit with full history

**What User Sees:**
- Habit name and category
- Description
- Start date
- Current streak (consecutive days completed)
- Total completions
- Completion rate (percentage)
- Calendar/history of past completions

**Database Operation:**
- Query Habits collection where user_id matches logged-in user
- Query Completions collection to calculate statistics
- Join data and display to user

---

#### Update/Edit Habit
**User Journey:**
1. User navigates to "My Habits" page
2. User clicks "Edit" button next to a habit
3. System loads habit details into edit form
4. Form is pre-filled with existing data:
   - Habit Name
   - Category
   - Description
   - Start Date
5. User modifies desired fields
6. User clicks "Update Habit" button
7. System validates inputs
8. System updates habit in database
9. User sees success message
10. Updated habit appears in habit list

**Database Operation:**
- Find habit document by habit_id and user_id (security check)
- Update document with new values
- Return success/failure status

---

#### Delete Habit
**User Journey:**
1. User navigates to "My Habits" page
2. User clicks "Delete" button next to a habit
3. System shows confirmation dialog: "Are you sure you want to delete this habit? This will also delete all completion history."
4. User confirms deletion
5. System removes habit and all associated completions from database
6. User sees success message
7. Habit is removed from habit list

**Database Operation:**
- Delete habit document from Habits collection (matching habit_id and user_id)
- Delete all completion documents from Completions collection (matching habit_id)
- Cascade delete ensures no orphaned data

---

### 3. Daily Check-in and Completion Tracking

#### Mark Habit as Complete
**User Journey:**
1. User navigates to "Today's Check-in" page
2. System displays list of all user's habits
3. For each habit, system checks if already completed today:
   - If completed: checkbox is checked, shows green checkmark
   - If not completed: checkbox is unchecked
4. User clicks checkbox to mark habit as complete/incomplete for today
5. System immediately saves completion to database
6. System recalculates streak
7. User sees updated streak counter (with celebration animation if streak increased)
8. Optional: User can add a quick note about the completion (e.g., "Felt great!")

**Database Operation:**
- Check if completion record exists for this habit_id + today's date
- If exists and user unchecks: Update completed = false
- If doesn't exist and user checks: Insert new completion record with completed = true
- If exists and user checks: Update completed = true
- Include optional note field

---

#### View Completion History
**User Journey:**
1. User clicks on a specific habit to view details
2. System displays:
   - Calendar view showing which days habit was completed (visual heatmap)
   - List view showing chronological history with dates and notes
   - Statistics panel showing:
     - Current streak (e.g., "7 days")
     - Longest streak (e.g., "15 days")
     - Total completions (e.g., "45 times")
     - Completion rate for last 7/30/90 days (e.g., "85%")

**Database Operation:**
- Query Completions collection for all records matching habit_id
- Sort by date descending
- Calculate statistics:
  - Current streak: Count consecutive days from today backwards where completed = true
  - Longest streak: Find longest sequence of consecutive completed days
  - Total completions: Count all records where completed = true
  - Completion rate: (completed days / total days since start) * 100

---

### 4. Progress Tracking & Analytics

  - Today's habits that need to be done
  - Habits with active streaks (motivational)
  - Recent activity feed

---

#### Habit-Specific Analytics
**What User Sees (Per Habit):**
- **Streak Information:**
  - Current streak with visual indicator (fire emoji, progress bar)
  - Longest streak achieved (personal best)
  - Streak history chart showing ups and downs
  
- **Completion Patterns:**
  - Calendar heatmap (like GitHub contribution graph)

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Architecture

### Collection 1: Users
**Purpose:** Store user account information

**Document Structure:**
```
{
  _id: ObjectId (auto-generated unique identifier)
  email: String (unique, user's email address)
  password: String (bcrypt hashed password)
  name: String (user's display name)
  created_at: DateTime (when account was created)
}
```

**Key Fields:**
- `_id`: Primary key, uniquely identifies each user
- `email`: Used for login, must be unique across all users
- `password`: Never stored as plain text, always hashed
- `name`: Displayed in UI (e.g., "Welcome back, John!")
- `created_at`: For analytics and account age tracking

**Relationships:**
- One user can have many habits (one-to-many)
- One user can have many completions (one-to-many)

---

### Collection 2: Habits
**Purpose:** Store habit definitions and metadata

**Document Structure:**
```
{
  _id: ObjectId (auto-generated unique identifier)
  user_id: ObjectId (reference to Users collection)
  name: String (habit name, e.g., "Morning Meditation")
  category: String (Health, Productivity, Finance, etc.)
  description: String (optional details about the habit)
  start_date: Date (when user wants to start tracking)
  created_at: DateTime (when habit was created in system)
}
```

**Key Fields:**
- `_id`: Primary key, uniquely identifies each habit
- `user_id`: Foreign key linking to Users collection (ensures data isolation)
- `name`: What the habit is called
- `category`: Groups similar habits together
- `description`: Additional context or motivation
- `start_date`: User-defined start (may differ from created_at)
- `created_at`: System timestamp

**Relationships:**
- Many habits belong to one user (many-to-one)
- One habit can have many completions (one-to-many)

---

### Collection 3: Completions
**Purpose:** Store daily completion records for each habit

**Document Structure:**
```
{
  _id: ObjectId (auto-generated unique identifier)
  habit_id: ObjectId (reference to Habits collection)
  user_id: ObjectId (reference to Users collection)
  completion_date: Date (which day this completion is for)
  completed: Boolean (true if done, false if skipped/failed)
  note: String (optional user note, e.g., "Felt energized!")
  logged_at: DateTime (when user marked it in system)
}
```

**Key Fields:**
- `_id`: Primary key, uniquely identifies each completion record
- `habit_id`: Foreign key linking to Habits collection
- `user_id`: Foreign key linking to Users collection (redundant but useful for queries)
- `completion_date`: The actual day being tracked (not when it was logged)
- `completed`: Boolean status
- `note`: Optional user reflection
- `logged_at`: System timestamp (may differ from completion_date if user logs retroactively)

**Relationships:**
- Many completions belong to one habit (many-to-one)
- Many completions belong to one user (many-to-one)

**Important Notes:**
- One completion record per habit per day
- If user marks today as complete, then unchecks, we update the same record (not create new one)
- completion_date is the date being tracked, logged_at is when it was entered

Users Collection
    |
    | (one user has many habits)
    |
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ> Habits Collection
             |
             | (one habit has many completions)
             |
             ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ> Completions Collection
```

**Example Data Flow:**
1. User "John" (user_id: 123) creates habit "Morning Exercise" (habit_id: 456)
2. John marks habit complete for today ‚Üí Creates completion record:
   - habit_id: 456 (links to Morning Exercise)
   - user_id: 123 (links to John)
   - completion_date: 2025-10-14
   - completed: true

**Queries:**
- "Show me all of John's habits" ‚Üí Query Habits where user_id = 123
- "Show me completion history for Morning Exercise" ‚Üí Query Completions where habit_id = 456
- "Show me all completions John made today" ‚Üí Query Completions where user_id = 123 AND completion_date = today

---

## üîê Security & Data Privacy

### Password Security
- **Never Store Plain Text Passwords:** All passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storage
- **Salt Rounds:** Bcrypt automatically adds salt to prevent rainbow table attacks
- **One-Way Hashing:** Impossible to reverse hash back to original password
- **Login Validation:** System compares hash of entered password with stored hash

### Data Isolation
- **User-Specific Queries:** Every database query includes user_id filter
- **No Cross-User Access:** User A cannot see or modify User B's data
- **Session-Based Access:** Only logged-in users can perform operations
- **Validation Checks:** Before updating/deleting, system verifies resource belongs to user

### Session Management
- **Streamlit Session State:** Stores user_id and authentication status
- **Session Expiry:** Session clears when user closes browser or logs out
- **No Session Hijacking:** Session data stored server-side, not in cookies

## üìä Key Calculations & Logic

### Streak Calculation Algorithm
```
Current Streak:
1. Start from today's date
2. Check if habit was completed today
   - If no: current streak = 0
   - If yes: continue to step 3
3. Count backwards day by day
4. For each day, check if habit was completed
   - If yes: increment streak counter
   - If no: stop counting, return current streak
5. Stop at habit's start_date

Example:
- Today (Oct 14): ‚úì Completed
- Oct 13: ‚úì Completed
- Oct 12: ‚úì Completed
- Oct 11: ‚úó Not completed
‚Üí Current Streak = 3 days
```

### Longest Streak Algorithm
```
1. Get all completion records for habit
2. Sort by date ascending
3. Initialize: current_run = 0, longest_run = 0
4. Loop through dates:
   - If consecutive day and completed:
     increment current_run
   - Else:
     if current_run > longest_run:
       longest_run = current_run
     reset current_run = 0
5. Return longest_run
```

### Completion Rate Calculation
```
Completion Rate = (Days Completed / Total Days) √ó 100

For specific period (e.g., last 30 days):
1. Count days from (today - 30 days) to today
2. Count how many of those days have completed = true
3. Calculate percentage

Example:
- Period: Last 30 days
- Days completed: 24
- Completion Rate = (24 / 30) √ó 100 = 80%
```

- User enters wrong password ‚Üí Show error message
- User leaves password field empty ‚Üí Show validation error
- Passwords don't match during signup ‚Üí Show error

### Habit Management
- User tries to create habit with empty name ‚Üí Prevent submission
- User deletes habit with completion history ‚Üí Confirm with warning
- User sets start date in the future ‚Üí Allow but don't show in "today's" list
- User has no habits ‚Üí Show empty state with "Create your first habit" message

### Completion Tracking
- User marks same habit complete twice in one day ‚Üí Update existing record
- User marks habit complete for date before habit's start date ‚Üí Prevent or warn
- User marks future date as complete ‚Üí Allow (for planning) or prevent
- Habit deleted but completions remain ‚Üí Cascade delete to avoid orphaned data

### Streaks
- Habit completed today but not yesterday ‚Üí Streak resets to 1
- Habit just created today ‚Üí Streak can be 0 or 1 based on first completion
- Streak calculation spans across months ‚Üí Handle date arithmetic correctly
